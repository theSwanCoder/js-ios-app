/**
 This class automatically updates/moves NSUserDefaults or/and Core Data if 
 application was updated from App Store. Idea is to store version of application 
 inside NSUserDefaults, and if that version was changed then perform update.
 Example: if old app was 1.0 version, and there was some major changes (i.e.
 changed database structure), after updating to 1.2 updates 1.1 and 1.2 will
 be performed (which adapts and move data from old to new database structure)
